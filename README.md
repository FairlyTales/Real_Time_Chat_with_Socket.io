## How to launch a project
- Open the `\server` directory and run `npm install` and `npm start` to launch the server side of the app.

- Go into the `\app` directory and open the `index.html` to launch the client side of the app (JS and CSS are inlined in the html, so it could be used without Live Server or other similar tools). Do this several times in different tabs/browsers.

- Enter name and message and click send. The message will be sent to the server and emited to all clients.
